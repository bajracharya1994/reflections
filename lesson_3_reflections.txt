When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It's better to use the remote repository than keeping all your work local when multiple people are working on a single project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   I think the manual pull is better than the automatic up-to-date of the remote repository with the local repository because you might not want all the work-in-progress files to be synced with the remote repository, and also because then you can selectively push files that you are sure that are working.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches are made from the project that a person is working on in order to experiment with new features. Clone makes a copy of other's project into your local disk. Fork is similar to cloning, but it doesnot change the source files of the clond repository but instead the repository is copied to your repository and all the changes you make happens in your repo instead of theirs.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
